# PicoCTF-Sloutions
# Introduction
I am new to cybersecurity and recently learned about CTF (Capture the Flag), a type of technical challenge. In this document, I will share my approach to solving these challenges. Although PicoCTF is designed for middle and high school students, I find it valuable as a beginner. I started solving these challenges while working on the Google Cyber Security certification and after completing the "Introduction to Computer Science" (CS50) and "Introduction to Programming with Python" (CS50P) courses from EdX and Harvard University. I will continue to add content as I delve deeper into the world of cybersecurity and as I take and complete additional courses.
