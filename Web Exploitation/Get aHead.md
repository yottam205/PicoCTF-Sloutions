##GET aHEAD

I enjoyed solving this one since I found an alternative way of solving it without using Burp Suite, as mentioned in the hints.

I started by clicking on the URL in the description, which led to a site with two buttons:

![Site with Two Buttons](https://github.com/yottam205/PicoCTF-Sloutions/assets/117525375/439dcf24-1784-42f2-bf91-f55c7420e77a)

I didn't really know what to do, so I investigated the HTML code of the website. The only thing I found in the HTML code was GET and POST commands for each of the buttons:

At this point, I decided to look at the hints. I didn't know what Burp Suite was, so I looked it up online and found out it is a great tool for penetration testing. In the context of this challenge, one of its features is to act as a proxy server between the user and the website, allowing modifications to the script to see how it affects the site.

I then went back to the challenge description and realized that the name "GET aHEAD" hinted at the solution! The first hint says, "Maybe you have more than 2 choices," which suggests trying to change one of the colors. I remembered a Linux command called `curl` that enables data exchange between a device and a server. This means I can exchange data without making changes.

I looked up the commands `curl` can execute and found the `--head` or `-I` option that displays all available information about a single file for HTTP, which is the website's protocol. I then went to the Webshell and tried it out:

```bash
curl -I http://mercury.picoctf.net:53554/
```

And the result was the flag:

To be honest, after solving that, I went online and searched for the other solution using Burp Suite. I recommend checking that one out too; it is important and a great tool to know how to work with!
