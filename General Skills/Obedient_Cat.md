**Obedient Cat**

After signing up, that’s the first challenge I saw:

I started by entering the Webshell. There you need to enter your username and password to start using the platform. 
I’ve made a new directory with the name of the challenge so it’ll be organized and navigated to that directory.

Then I went back to the challenge and right clicked on the link so I can get the download link in to the shell:

In the shell I’ve downloaded the file using the ‘wget’ command and pasting the url I’ve copied:

As you can see in the picture, there was only one file named “flag”, not specifying what kind of file it is.
I tried to open the file using the ‘cat’ command and inside the file was the flag:

I didn’t feel it was necessary to take pictures of pasting the flag back in the challenge window.
The challenge was super easy and required almost no previous skills to figure out what is going on in it. Please note I didn’t use the hints although it is important to feel free and comfortable to use them, because at the end of the day, what we’re trying to do is to learn.
